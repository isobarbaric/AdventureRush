### d. Logout

## 5. Gameplay/Objective

Upon entering a level you will be presented with a yellow rectangle on the far right side of the frame. This rectangle is the end zone upon which you must reach to complete the level. Upon making contact with the endzone, you will complete the level and be sent back to the level select screen. Green platforms are safe while red platforms are lava and will send you back to the beginning of the level. To move the character around the screen use the "w" key to jump, "a" to move to the left and "d" to move to the right. To exit from a level and return to the level select screen, you can click the escape button to abort the level. If you successfully complete a level, then you will be returned to the level select window.

If a particular user has enough coins to purchase a specific sprite, then that particular sprite can be purchased.

## 7. Termination
Upon selecting the Exit button on the login screen (while not logged in), the program will terminate.
